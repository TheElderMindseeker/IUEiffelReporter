## Compile Guide

This guide is independent of the system you are using (it must work properly on Windows, Linux and Mac OS but it was only tested on Linux and Windows).

The system is written in Eiffel programming language so for compilation it needs EiffelStudio IDE or equivalently Eiffel Compiler used from console interface (recommended only for experienced users). To get EiffelStudio IDE, please, visit official Eiffel page www.eiffel.com; the minimal supported version of EiffelStudio is 16.04;

### General Project Structure

The __IUEiffelReporter__ directory has the following structure:

    ./ # root IUEiffelReporter directory
      \  
      |-- project/ # directory with main project source files for compilation. Attention: main project .ecf file is situated here
      |
      \-- README.txt # the document you are currently reading`

### Compilation

Start EiffelStudio and open .ecf project file at `./project/` directory. You can either open it with compile action or compile it manually by pressing "Compile" button after the project loaded. For maximal performance you can _finalize_ the project (recommended only for experienced users).
